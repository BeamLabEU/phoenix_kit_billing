defmodule PhoenixKitBilling.Migrations do
  @moduledoc """
  Module-owned versioned migrations for `phoenix_kit_billing` — the
  decentralized-migrations protocol that core's `mix phoenix_kit.update`
  discovers via `migration_module/0`: `current_version/0` +
  `migrated_version_runtime/1` + idempotent `up/1` + version-aware
  `down/1`. `phoenix_kit_legal` (over `phoenix_kit_consent_logs`) is the
  closest sibling example of this exact situation — a core-created table
  whose future shape a module chain adopts.

  ## Ownership situation — read before touching

  `phoenix_kit_payment_provider_configs` is one of core's V135 baseline
  tables. Nothing in this package's `lib/` reads or writes it today — it
  is currently orphaned application-code-wise, though core still creates
  it (and can still roll it back on its own baseline `down`). Payment
  provider credentials this package actually reads and writes today live
  in `phoenix_kit_settings`, via `PhoenixKitBilling.Providers` — this
  version changes NONE of that.

  V1 is purely an ADOPTION step:

    * on existing installs the table is already there (core V135), the
      `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` finds it, and the only new object is
      the `pkb_schema:1` marker — from then on this chain owns the
      table's future shape;
    * on a hypothetical future install whose core baseline no longer
      creates the table, the same statements create it — shape-identical
      to core's V135, with core's exact index and constraint names.

  Because V1 changes no shape, core's `ExpectedSchema` manifest (which
  still audits the V135 shape of this table) stays accurate and NO core
  release is required for this version.

  ## What `down/1` is NOT

  `down/1` unstamps the version marker; it NEVER drops
  `phoenix_kit_payment_provider_configs`. The table is core-created, and
  rolling back this module's chain must not destroy it — only core's own
  baseline rollback does that. The same invariant holds for V2 below —
  `down/1` never drops a core-created table, even one whose shape this
  chain now owns.

  The migrated version is tracked as a `pkb_schema:<N>` COMMENT on
  `phoenix_kit_payment_provider_configs` (the marker convention from the
  projects/legal chains, namespaced). A marker-less table reads as
  version 0 — the core-baseline shape before this chain existed.

  ## V2 — `phoenix_kit_currencies` gets a shape

  `phoenix_kit_currencies` is likewise a core-created table (V31
  baseline), and likewise untouched by V1 above (an unrelated table). V2
  is this chain's first shape-CHANGING step, entirely on
  `phoenix_kit_currencies`:

    * a partial unique index `phoenix_kit_currencies_default_uidx` on
      `(is_default) WHERE is_default` — today uniqueness of the default
      currency is held only by the transaction in
      `set_default_currency/1`, not by the database: two
      `is_default = true` rows raise `Ecto.MultipleResultsError` out of
      `get_default_currency/0` (`Ecto.Repo.one/2`). This index is also a
      prerequisite for a `LIMIT`-less `WHERE is_default` backfill a future
      chain runs against this table, so it must exist before that
      backfill runs, not merely by the time it finishes.
      A host can already BE in the two-default state the index forbids, so
      V2 demotes every default but one (lowest `sort_order`, then oldest)
      immediately before creating the index — otherwise `CREATE UNIQUE
      INDEX` aborts the whole chain on exactly those databases. That
      `UPDATE` is the one row-level write this chain makes to a
      core-created table, and it only repairs a state no reader can
      handle: `get_default_currency/0` raises on it today.
    * `rounding_rule character varying(16) NOT NULL DEFAULT 'exact'` and
      `rate_updated_at timestamp with time zone` — both additions with no
      reader anywhere in this version; the default reproduces today's
      rounding behavior exactly, so nothing observable changes for any
      host that migrates to V2.

  Both ride in the same chain version because this chain moves one
  version per module per release, not one version per column. `down/1`
  to below V2 drops the index and both columns — never the table.

  ## V3 — `phoenix_kit_orders` gets its frozen-currency columns

  `phoenix_kit_orders` is another core-created table this chain does not
  otherwise own. `PhoenixKitBilling.Order` (§4.5/§9.1 of the per-domain-
  currency spec) declares `base_currency`, `exchange_rate` and
  `base_total` — the shop's base currency and the rate an order was
  actually priced at, frozen at creation — but the core release that was
  originally meant to add these columns (an unreleased "V186", adding the
  identical three columns with the identical types) had not shipped to
  Hex when the schema change did. Any host resolving the currently
  published core got an `Order` struct whose SELECT lists columns the
  database does not have, and `Ecto.Repo.all/2`/`get/2`/`one/2` on
  `Order` — hit by `list_orders/1`, `get_order/1`, the user dashboard's
  orders LiveView, `delete_order/1` — all raised
  `Postgrex.Error (undefined_column)` instead of returning data.

  V3 closes that gap the same way V2 closed one on `phoenix_kit_currencies`:
  this chain adds the columns itself rather than waiting on a core
  release. The three `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` statements
  use the exact names and types core's own eventual migration does, so
  the day that core release ships, its `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` finds
  the columns already here and no-ops — and its backfill (deriving
  `base_currency`/`exchange_rate`/`base_total` for pre-existing rows from
  `phoenix_kit_currencies`) still runs and still does useful work,
  because V3 deliberately adds the columns nullable with NO backfill of
  its own: inventing a derivation here would duplicate — and risk
  disagreeing with — logic that belongs to whichever release actually
  owns getting it right. Every reader of these three fields already
  treats `nil` as "unknown", per `Order`'s own moduledoc, so an
  unbackfilled column breaks nothing between V3 and that release.

  `down/1` to below V3 drops the three columns — never the table, same
  invariant as V1/V2.

  ## V4 — adoption of the remaining ten core-baseline tables

  Every other `phoenix_kit_billing` table is, like V1's and V2/V3's
  target tables, a core baseline table: core's V135 created them, and
  later core versions have amended some (V162 added
  `payment_option_uuid`, its FK and its index to `phoenix_kit_orders`;
  V164 renamed the `subscription_types` slug index). V4 ADOPTS that
  shape, table by table, for the ten this chain did not already reach:
  billing profiles, currencies, invoices, orders, transactions, payment
  methods, subscriptions, webhook events, payment options, subscription
  types.

  Same Phase-0 contract as V1: every statement reproduces core's shape
  for the table under core's exact object names, so an install where
  core already created these tables sees a pure no-op and the only new
  object is the version marker. On a future install whose core baseline
  no longer creates them, the same statements create them.

  For `phoenix_kit_currencies` and `phoenix_kit_orders` specifically, V4's
  `CREATE TABLE` intentionally reproduces the base V135 shape ONLY — it
  does not repeat `rounding_rule`/`rate_updated_at` (owned by V2 above)
  or `base_currency`/`exchange_rate`/`base_total` (owned by V3 above).
  Those columns are this chain's own later versions' property; restating
  them here would either duplicate V2/V3's `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS` (at
  best redundant) or drift from their exact DDL (at worst wrong).

  Statement order is load-bearing: tables, then primary keys and unique
  constraints, then indexes, then foreign keys last — by which point
  every referenced table and referenced key exists, whatever order the
  tables themselves were created in.

  **A known, undocumented-by-fix ordering gap:** on a real install, core's
  baseline always creates `phoenix_kit_currencies`/`phoenix_kit_orders`
  before this chain runs, so V2's and V3's `ALTER TABLE` statements
  always find their table — this is the situation every real host is in
  today. But this chain's own stated hypothetical for V1-V3 — "a future
  core baseline that no longer creates these tables" — has a gap for
  these two tables specifically: `up_statements/2` runs `v1 ++ v2 ++ v3
  ++ v4` in that order, so on such a hypothetical fresh install, V2's
  `ALTER TABLE phoenix_kit_currencies` and V3's `ALTER TABLE
  phoenix_kit_orders` would run BEFORE V4's `CREATE TABLE` for those same
  tables — and fail. This gap already exists for V2 and V3 today (both
  already assume the table pre-exists, independently of V4); V4 does not
  introduce it, it only inherits it for two of its ten tables. Fixing it
  would mean reordering V1-V3, which are published and frozen — left as
  a known limitation rather than silently ignored.

  `down/1` to below V4 never drops any of the ten tables — same
  invariant as V1/V2/V3, and, like V1, V4 changes no shape of its own
  (it only creates what core's baseline already creates), so there is
  nothing for `down/1` to undo beyond the marker.
