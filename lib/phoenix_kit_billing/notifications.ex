defmodule PhoenixKitBilling.Notifications do
  @moduledoc """
  Billing notifications: who hears about an invoice or a payment, and when.

  Sends go through core's notification layer, so each recipient's own
  per-type preferences and delivery channels (in-app inbox, email,
  Telegram, digest cadence) apply. This module only decides the audience
  and the copy.

  ## Recipients

  `admin_recipients/1` unions three sources, because no single one is
  complete:

    * holders of the relevant permission key (`users_with_permission/1`)
    * **Owner-role holders**, whose access is implicit and who therefore
      have no permission rows at all
    * holders of the `"*"` superadmin key, likewise absent from a
      key-specific query

  A resolver that queried only the first would miss the primary operator
  of a default install — the person most likely to want the notification.

  ## Money copy carries no PII

  Notification text names an invoice or order NUMBER and an amount, never
  a customer name, address or email: a notification lands in someone's
  inbox and can be routed onward to email or Telegram.

  ## Failure is never fatal

  Every send is wrapped. A notification reports a committed fact — a
  payment that has been recorded, an invoice that has been issued — and
  must never be able to undo it.
