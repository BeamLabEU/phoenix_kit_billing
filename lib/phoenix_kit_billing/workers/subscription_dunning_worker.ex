defmodule PhoenixKitBilling.Workers.SubscriptionDunningWorker do
  @moduledoc """
  Oban worker for dunning (failed payment recovery).

  When a subscription payment fails, the subscription enters `past_due` status
  and this worker handles retry attempts during the grace period.

  ## Dunning Process

  1. Initial payment fails → subscription status = `past_due`
  2. Grace period starts (configurable, default 3 days)
  3. This worker retries payment at intervals, on the invoice of the period
     (see `SubscriptionCharge`), so the money reaches the ledger
  4. If payment succeeds → status = `active`
  5. If max attempts reached or grace period ends → status = `cancelled`, and the
     invoice is voided: nothing is owed for a period that was not given — unless the
     period's invoice was paid some other way (*Mark paid*), which moves the period on
     before either is looked at

  A declined retry is a handled outcome, not a failed job. Returned as an error, Oban
  would retry it within seconds: each try counts, so one decline would use up every
  attempt and cancel the subscription in about a minute.

  ## Retry Schedule

  Default retry schedule (can be configured):
  - Attempt 1: Immediate (handled by RenewalWorker)
  - Attempt 2: 24 hours later
  - Attempt 3: 48 hours later (2 days)
  - Attempt 4: 72 hours later (3 days, grace period ends)

  ## Configuration

  ```elixir
  # Settings (stored in database)
  billing_subscription_grace_days: 3
  billing_dunning_max_attempts: 3
  ```

  ## Manual Trigger

  ```elixir
  %{subscription_uuid: "019145a1-0000-7000-8000-000000000001"}
  |> SubscriptionDunningWorker.new()
  |> Oban.insert()
