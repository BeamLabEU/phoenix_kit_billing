defmodule PhoenixKitBilling.OrderEvents do
  @moduledoc """
  A durable way for OTHER modules to learn that an order was paid, refunded or
  cancelled.

  `PhoenixKitBilling.InvoiceEvents` only fires for invoices, and an order can be
  paid without one. The `{:order_paid, order}` PubSub broadcast is a
  notification, not a delivery: a listener that was restarting never hears it,
  and whatever the order was for (stock to write off, an email to send) never
  happens.

  An order paid through its invoice fires this `:paid` as well as the invoice's
  own, so a module listening to both must not act twice.

  ## Events

  - `:paid` - the order became `"paid"`, directly or through its invoice.
  - `:refunded` - the order became `"refunded"`. That takes a full refund: a
    partial one leaves the order `"paid"` and fires no order event (the invoice's
    `:refunded` fires for every refund).
  - `:cancelled` - the order became `"cancelled"`.

  A refused transition fires nothing. Neither does moving an order to the trash
  or restoring it, which change no status.

  ## For a module that wants to hear

  Export `billing_order_event_handlers/0` from your `PhoenixKit.Module`,
  returning handler modules. Each implements:

      @spec handle_order_event(:paid | :refunded | :cancelled, PhoenixKitBilling.Order.t()) ::
              :ok | {:error, term()}

  Duck-typed - no compile-time dependency on billing - the same pattern as
  `InvoiceEvents`, so an optional billing integration costs nothing when billing
  is absent. A host app can also list handlers:

      config :phoenix_kit_billing, order_event_handlers: [MyApp.OrderHandler]

  ## Guarantees

  - The event is enqueued in the **same database transaction** that changed the
    order's status: it is committed with the status or not at all.
  - **One Oban job per (event, handler)**: a failing handler retries alone and
    never holds up another module.
  - **At-least-once.** A handler must be idempotent. Each job carries an
    `event_uuid`, which Oban uses so an event reaches a handler through one job;
    it does not cover a retry of that job, and it is not passed to the handler.
    Key a handler's idempotency on the order's uuid and the event instead: an
    order can reach each of these statuses only once, so that pair identifies
    the event.
  - The handler receives the order **as it is now** - re-read when the job runs,
    with `:billing_profile` loaded - not a snapshot from when it was enqueued. A
    `:paid` delivered late can find the order already `"refunded"`.
  - A job may only call a handler that is registered *when it runs*: job
    arguments are data, never a license to invoke an arbitrary module.

  The jobs run on the `:billing` queue, which billing declares through
  `oban_queues/0`. A node that does not run it delivers nothing: the jobs wait.

  PubSub still fires for live screens, after the commit.
