defmodule PhoenixKitBilling.Web.PrintLvsTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression tests for the four printable/receipt LiveViews: InvoicePrint,
  ReceiptPrint, CreditNotePrint, PaymentConfirmationPrint.

  Each `do_mount` fetches the invoice with an explicit `:preload` list that
  must cover every association the corresponding `.heex` template reads.
  `Billing.get_invoice/2` only preloads `:order` by default, and
  `%Ecto.Association.NotLoaded{}` is truthy — so a template guard like
  `if @invoice.user do ... @invoice.user.email` still crashes with
  `KeyError: key :email not found in: #Ecto.Association.NotLoaded<...>`
  when `:user` is missing from the preload list, exactly as reported by
  the owner against `/receipt` and `/print`.

  These tests build a real, persisted invoice (with a real transaction)
  and mount the print route directly, so they exercise the actual
  `Billing.get_invoice/2`/`Billing.get_transaction/2` calls, not a stub.
