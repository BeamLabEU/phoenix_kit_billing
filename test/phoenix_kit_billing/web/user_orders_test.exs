defmodule PhoenixKitBilling.Web.UserOrdersTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression tests for the customer-facing "My Orders" LiveView
  (`/dashboard/billing-orders`).

  `Billing.list_user_orders/3`'s new `:preload` option is what makes this
  page work at all — the association is unloaded by default, and the
  template reads `order.invoices` and `invoice.transactions` for every
  order it renders. Test 1 below doubles as the regression guard for that:
  confirmed red (`** (Ecto.Association.NotLoaded) ...` /
  `Protocol.UndefinedError` on `Enum.empty?(order.invoices)`, depending on
  which line hits the unloaded struct first) against a version of
  `UserOrders.mount/3` with `preload: [invoices: :transactions]` dropped
  from the `list_user_orders/3` call, green again once restored.
