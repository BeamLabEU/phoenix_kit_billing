defmodule PhoenixKitBilling.Web.InvoiceDetailTest do
  @moduledoc """
  Regression test for `PhoenixKitBilling.Web.InvoiceDetail.Actions.reload_invoice/1`.

  `handle_params/3` fetches the invoice with
  `preload: [:order, :transactions, :user]`, so `@invoice.user` is safe on
  first render. But `record_payment/1` and `record_refund/1` both call the
  private `reload_invoice/1` afterwards, which re-fetches the invoice with
  `preload: [:order, :transactions]` — dropping `:user`. The next render
  hits `invoice_detail.html.heex`'s `<%= if @invoice.user do %>` /
  `{@invoice.user.email}` block, and since `%Ecto.Association.NotLoaded{}`
  is truthy, `.email` on it raises the same
  `KeyError: key :email not found in: #Ecto.Association.NotLoaded<...>`
  the owner hit on the print routes.
