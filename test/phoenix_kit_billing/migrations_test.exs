  Pins the ownership design for `phoenix_kit_payment_provider_configs`:
  this package owns the table's FUTURE shape through its module migration
  chain, while core's V135 baseline still creates the table on every
  install and the chain's V1 merely ADOPTS it (stamps the `pkb_schema:`
  marker, changes no shape).

  No application code in this package reads or writes this table today —
  provider credentials still live in `phoenix_kit_settings`. This version
  is only the adoption step; see the moduledoc in
  `PhoenixKitBilling.Migrations`.

  Every test here is a pure data/string assertion over
  `up_statements/1`/`down_statements/2`/`up/1`/`down/1`-as-source-text and
  core's static `PhoenixKit.Migrations.ExpectedSchema.objects/1` manifest —
  none of them touch a database.
