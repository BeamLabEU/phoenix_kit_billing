defmodule PhoenixKitBilling.Regression.ActivityLogFailureVisibilityTest do
  @moduledoc """
  A logging failure must come back as something distinguishable from
  success. `Activity.log/2` delegates to `PhoenixKit.Activity.log/3`,
  which turns a raise or an exit into a logged, returned `{:error, _}` —
  this pins that billing's call still gets that result and a log line,
  rather than a bare `:ok` or a crash.

  `DBConnection.OwnershipError` is reached for real, not mocked:
  `async: true` puts the test repo in non-shared ownership mode (see
  `data_case.ex`), and the logging call runs inside a bare `spawn/1`
  process — not `Task.async/1`, which sets `$callers` and gets
  auto-allowed onto the spawning process's sandbox connection, defeating
  the point of this test.
